## Method

![example](https://github.com/HanRuize/DSAR-CF/blob/master/figs/example.png)

In the proposed DSAR-CF, we first introduce object saliency information into the regularization weight map to highlight the appearance of the player as well as suppressing the background information around the player at the first frame.  
We then propose a strategy to dynamically update the regularization weight map to reflect the playerâ€™s shape variations in the subsequent frames.  
We then develop a level-set algorithm to iteratively optimize the regularization weight map in each frame.
